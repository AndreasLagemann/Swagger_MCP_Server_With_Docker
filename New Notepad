## What I want this project to be able to do:

# Completed Tasks Done

- Downloads a Swagger specification and stores it locally for faster reference - ✅
- Request a list of all endpoints - Returns the HTTP Methods and descriptions - ✅
- Request a list of the models used by an endpoint - Returns a list of all the models used by the endpoint - ✅
- Request a TypeScript code block for the model definition (passing in the model name) - Return a block of TS code for the model definition - ✅
- Request a TypeScript code block for the Model Context Protocol Tool definition (passing in the endpoint name) - Return a block of TS code for the MCP tool definition - ✅

# All the following MCP functions will need to have the Swagger File passed in from the .swagger-mcp file in the root of the solution, we will then be getting all the following data from this file:

## Maybe work on these later
- Request service to connect to the end point
- Request MCP function definitions
